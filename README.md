  <p align="center">Repository pattern using nestjs, prisma and graphql.</p>

## Description

Abstract repository pattern for decoupling data access logic from business logic. This pattern is useful for testing, as it allows you to mock the repository and test the business logic in isolation. This pattern is also useful for code organization, as it allows you to separate the data access code from the business logic code.
